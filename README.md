# libsm64-blender - Blender client for LibSM64

This add-on integrates [libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64) into Blender and provides various additional integrations with [Fast64](https://bitbucket.org/kurethedead/fast64/).
Practically, this means if you're making levels with Fast64 in Blender, you can use this add-on to drop a controller-playable Mario into your scene to run around and test your terrain layout.

### Current Features

### Near-term Features

### Far-term Features
